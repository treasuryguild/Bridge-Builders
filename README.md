# Bridge Builders

**Bridge Builders** are people who are passionate about people. We are insanely curious and love to learn about who you are and what you do. We seek to meet and learn about people, projects, and opportunities so we can help to create bridges between them and increase the value of the network and community. We know that the value of the network grows exponentially (see: [Metcalfâ€™s law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe's\_law)) as we add more and more connections. Our purpose is to act as an accelerator for uncovering and fostering serendipitous discovery and collaboration by helping people and projects in the ecosystem connect and collaborate.
